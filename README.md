# Alzheimer-Detection---neural-network
analysis in progress

The Dataset is consists of Preprocessed MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Images.
All the images are resized into 128 x 128 pixels.
The Dataset has four classes of images.
The Dataset is consists of total 6400 MRI images.
Class - 1: Mild Demented (896 images)
Class - 2: Moderate Demented (64 images)
Class - 3: Non Demented (3200 images)
Class - 4: Very Mild Demented (2240 images)

Motive
The main motive behind sharing this dataset is to design/develop an accurate framework or architecture for the classification of Alzheimers Disease

 I also include an explanation regarding Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and key concepts related to explained variance.
